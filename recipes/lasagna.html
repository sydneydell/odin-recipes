    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients for making lasagna on a kitchen countertop.</li>
        <li>Cook 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, ¾ pound lean ground beef, ½ cup minced onion, and 2 cloves garlic, crushed, in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes, 2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce, 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste, and ½ cup water. Season with 2 tablespoons white sugar, 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (divided), 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon fennel seeds, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, and 1 ½ teaspoons salt (divided, or to taste). Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 12 lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine 16 ounces ricotta cheese with 1 egg, 2 tablespoons parsley (remaining), and ½ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread ½ of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with 1/3 of the ¾ pound mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers: add more meat sauce, the remaining mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: either spray the foil with cooking spray or ensure it does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
